# TODO

 - [x] When editing HCP via player edit form, hcp update in events is bypassed;
    - ~~do not allow to edit HCP via player edit form~~ (DONE: HCP field is now disabled on Players page)

# QUESTIONS

 - [ ] When updating HCP/Tee for a player and he has matches within event - what should we do?
 - [ ] Need to re-think model of copying course into event - maybe should allow to update course data, but update future events as well. Though Tee names can change, etc. So it is a mess.
    - could store course snapshots;
